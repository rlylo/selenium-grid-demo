Friday SG Live 02 --> Today Agenda 

- What is Jenkins ? 

- What is Selenium Grid ? 


  LOCAL 
     - CukesRunner 
     		- browser=remote-chrome
     		- Execution will happen one by one, even if SG has available nodes for executions 
     		  ( Since execution started from CukesRunner)


     - Maven 
     		- browser=remote-chrome
     		- Execution will happen PARALLEL 


    How Driver Class decide which browser will use ? 
			
			String browserType="";
            if (System.getProperty("BROWSER") == null) {
                browserType = ConfigurationReader.getProperty("browser");
            } else {
                browserType = System.getProperty("BROWSER");
            }


        Scn 01 --> 

        	config.properties 
        		browser=chrome

        		mvn test 

        		Execution will happen local browser since we did not provide any 
        		Parameter from command line to select which browser gonna work 


        Scn 02 --> 

        	config.properties 
        		browser=chrome

        		mvn test -DBROWSER=remote-chrome 

        		-D --> Define System Property 

        		-DBROWSER=remote-chrome

        		   KEY   = VALUE 


        PRACTICE 

        	mvn test -Demail=mike@cydeo.com -Dpass=123456 

        	email - System.getProperty("email");
        	pass  - System.getProperty("pass");



  REMOTE (Jenkins)
     - Maven
     - System.getEnv();

  	  	 CRON EXPRESSION  -> With the help cron we can schedule test execution time in Jenkins 
  	  	 				  -> Based on expression that we provided Jenkins execution will start 
  	  	 				   
  	  	 				   https://crontab.guru

  	  1- Build With Parameters 

  	     I have Build with Parameters job that works according to selected parameters 
  	     	- BROWSER_TYPE --> chrome,firefox,remote-chrome etc
  	     	- TEST_TYPE    --> @smoke - @regression 
  	     	- ENV_TYPE     --> dev - test -stag

Question 
	- I received the AWS Free Tier limit alert as has exceeded 85% of the usage limit for AmazonEC2, What do I do now? 

	Total free usage per MONTH --> 750 hours  --> 12 MONTHS 

	One month max 31 DAYS --> that makes --> 31 x 24 --> 744 hours 

	That means NO WAY to EXCEED LIMITS --> AS LONG AS you have ONLY one server 

	Why you have this message ? 

	26 x 24 --> 624 hours 

	624 / 750 --> 0.83 --> %85
